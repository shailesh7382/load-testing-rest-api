= Load Testing Strategy for Pricing and Trading REST API

== Objectives
- Validate system stability, scalability, and performance under expected and peak loads.
- Identify bottlenecks and ensure SLAs (latency, throughput, error rate) are met.
- Test both pricing (read-heavy) and trading (write-heavy) endpoints.

== Key Terminologies
- *Throughput*: Number of requests processed per second (RPS).
- *Latency*: Time taken to process a request (average, p95, p99).
- *Concurrency*: Number of simultaneous users or threads.
- *Error Rate*: Percentage of failed requests.
- *SLA (Service Level Agreement)*: Performance targets (e.g., 95% of requests < 200ms).
- *Soak Test*: Long-duration test to check stability.
- *Spike Test*: Sudden increase in load to test resilience.
- *Baseline Test*: Establishing current performance metrics.

== Test Scenarios
- *Baseline Load*: Simulate average daily traffic.
- *Peak Load*: Simulate maximum expected traffic (e.g., market open/close).
- *Stress Test*: Increase load until system fails to identify breaking points.
- *Soak Test*: Run at peak load for several hours to detect memory leaks or degradation.
- *Spike Test*: Sudden surges in traffic to test auto-scaling and recovery.

== Metrics to Monitor
- Response time (avg, p95, p99)
- Throughput (RPS)
- Error rates (4xx, 5xx)
- CPU, memory, and network usage
- Database and external service latencies

== Tools
- *Load Generation*: JMeter, Gatling, Locust
- *API Testing*: Rest Assured (for functional/integration tests)
- *Monitoring*: Prometheus, Grafana, Spring Boot Actuator

== Managing Expectations
- Define clear SLAs for each endpoint.
- Communicate test results and bottlenecks to stakeholders.
- Plan for capacity based on test findings.
- Document limitations and recommended scaling strategies.

== Continuous Testing
- Integrate load tests into CI/CD pipelines for early detection of regressions.
